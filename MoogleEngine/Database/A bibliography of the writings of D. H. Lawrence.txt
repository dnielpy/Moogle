THE BAD SIDE OF BOOKS

BY D. H. LAWRENCE


There doesn’t seem much excuse for me, sitting under a little cedar tree
at the foot of the Rockies, looking at the pale desert disappearing
westward, with hummocks of shadow rising in the stillness of incipient
autumn, this morning, the near pine trees perfectly still, the sunflowers
and the purple michaelmas daisies moving for the first time, this
morning, in an invisible breath of breeze, to be writing an introduction
to a bibliography.

Books to me are incorporate things, voices in the air, that do not
disturb the haze of autumn, and visions that don’t blot out the
sunflowers. What do I care for first or last editions? I have never read
one of my own published works. To me, no book has a date, no book has a
binding.

What do I care if “e” is somewhere upside down, or “g” comes from the
wrong fount? I really don’t.

And when I force myself to remember, what pleasure is there in that? The
very first copy of _The White Peacock_ that was ever sent out, I put into
my mother’s hands when she was dying. She looked at the outside, and then
at the title-page, and then at me, with darkening eyes. And though she
loved me so much, I think she doubted whether it could be much of a book,
since no-one more important than I had written it. Somewhere, in the
helpless privacies of her being, she had wistful respect for me. But for
me in the face of the world, not much. This David would never get a stone
across at Goliath. And why try? Let Goliath alone!—Anyway, she was beyond
reading my first immortal work. It was put aside, and I never wanted to
see it again. She never saw it again.

After the funeral, my father struggled through half a page, and it might
as well have been Hottentot.

“And what dun they gi’e thee for that, lad?”

“Fifty pounds, father.”

“Fifty pound!” He was dumbfounded, and looked at me with shrewd eyes, as
if I were a swindler. “Fifty pound! An’ tha’s niver done a day’s hard
work in thy life.”

I think to this day, he looks upon me as a sort of cleverish swindler,
who gets money for nothing: a sort of Ernest Hooley. And my sister says,
to my utter amazement: “You _always_ were lucky!”

Somehow, it is the actual corpus and substance, the actual paper and rag
volume of any of my works, that calls up these personal feelings and
memories. It is the miserable tome itself which somehow delivers me to
the vulgar mercies of the world. The voice inside is mine forever. But
the beastly marketable chunk of a published volume is a bone which every
dog presumes to pick with me.

William Heinemann published _The White Peacock_. I saw him once; and then
I realized what an immense favour he was doing me. As a matter of fact,
he treated me quite well.

I remember, at the last minute, when the book was all printed and ready
to bind: some even bound: they sent me in great haste a certain page
with a marked paragraph. Would I remove this paragraph, as it might be
considered “objectionable,” and substitute an exactly identical number
of obviously harmless words. Hastily I did so. And later, I noticed that
the two pages, on one of which was the altered paragraph, were rather
loose, not properly bound in to the book.—Only my mother’s copy had the
paragraph unchanged.

I have wondered often if Heinemann’s just altered the “objectionable” bit
in the first little batch of books they sent out, then left the others as
first printed. Or whether they changed all but the one copy they sent me
ahead.

It was my first experience of the objectionable. Later, William Heinemann
said he thought _Sons and Lovers_ one of the dirtiest books he had ever
read. He refused to publish it.—I should not have thought the deceased
gentleman’s reading had been so circumspectly narrow.

I forget the first appearance of _The Trespasser_ and _Sons and Lovers_.
I always hide the fact of publication from myself as far as possible. One
writes, even at this moment, to some mysterious presence in the air. If
that presence were not there, and one thought of even a single solitary
actual reader, the paper would remain forever white.

But I always remember how, in a cottage by the sea, in Italy, I re-wrote
almost entirely that play, _The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd_, right on the
proofs which Mitchell Kennerley had sent me. And he nobly forbore with me.

But then he gave me a nasty slap. He published _Sons and Lovers_ in
America, and one day, joyful, arrived a cheque for twenty pounds. Twenty
pounds in those days was a little fortune: and as it was a windfall, it
was handed over to Madame; the first pin-money she had seen. Alas and
alack, there was an alteration in the date of the cheque, and the bank
would not cash it. It was returned to Mitchell Kennerley, but that was
the end of it. He never made good, and never to this day made any further
payment for _Sons and Lovers_. Till this year of grace 1924, America has
had that, my most popular book, for nothing—as far as I am concerned.

Then came the first edition of _The Rainbow_. I’m afraid I set my rainbow
in the sky too soon, before, instead of after the deluge. Methuen
published that book, and he almost wept before the magistrate, when he
was summoned for bringing out a piece of indecent literature. He said
he did not know the dirty thing he had been handling, he had not read
the work, his reader had misadvised him—and _Peccavi! Peccavi!_ wept the
now be-knighted gentleman. Then around me arose such a fussy sort of
interest, as when a really scandalous bit of scandal is being whispered
about one. In print my fellow-authors kept scrupulously silent, lest a
bit of the tar might stick to them. Later Arnold Bennett and May Sinclair
raised a kindly protest. But John Galsworthy told me, very calmly and ex
cathedra, he thought the book a failure as a work of art.—They think as
they please. But why not wait till I ask them, before they deliver an
opinion to me? Especially as impromptu opinions by elderly authors are
apt to damage him who gives as much as him who takes.

There is no more indecency or impropriety in _The Rainbow_ than there is
in this autumn morning—I, who say so, ought to know. And when I open my
mouth, let no dog bark.

So much for the first edition of _The Rainbow_. The only copy of any
of my books I ever keep is my copy of Methuen’s _Rainbow_. Because
the American editions have all been mutilated. And this is almost my
favourite among my novels: this, and _Women in Love_. And I should really
be best pleased if it were never re-printed at all, and only those blue,
condemned volumes remained extant.

Since _The Rainbow_, one submits to the process of publication as to a
necessary evil: as souls are said to submit to the necessary evil of
being born into the flesh. The wind bloweth where it listeth. And one
must submit to the processes of one’s day. Personally, I have no belief
in the vast public. I believe that only the winnowed few can care. But
publishers, like thistle, must set innumerable seeds on the wind, knowing
most will miscarry.

To the vast public, the autumn morning is only a sort of stage background
against which they can display their own mechanical importance. But to
some men still the trees stand up and look around at the daylight, having
woven the two ends of darkness together into visible being and presence.
And soon, they will let go the two ends of darkness again, and disappear.
A flower laughs once, and having had his laugh, chuckles off into seed,
and is gone. Whence? Whither? Who knows, who cares? That little laugh of
achieved being is all.

So it is with books. To every man who struggles with his own soul in
mystery, a book that is a book flowers once, and seeds, and is gone.
First editions or forty-first are only the husks of it.

Yet if it amuses a man to save the husks of the flower that opened once
for the first time, one can understand that too. It is like the costumes
that men and women used to wear, in their youth, years ago, and which now
stand up rather faded in museums. With a jolt they reassemble for us the
day-to-day actuality of the by-gone people, and we see the trophies once
more of man’s eternal fight with inertia.

INTRODUCTION


This book, a record of the published writings of Mr. D. H. Lawrence,
follows the general plan of the _Centaur Bibliographies_ which have
preceded it. The opening section contains collations of the first issues
of Mr. Lawrence’s books, twenty-seven in all. Among these collations
is that of _Movements in European History_, a book written by Mr.
Lawrence, published under the _nom de plume_ Lawrence H. Davison, and
never heretofore openly attributed to him. Many of the collations are
accompanied by notes. Some of these discuss bibliographical points which
could not be adequately covered in the more technical descriptions of the
books; others estimate the relative scarcity of the various items, or
give information about interesting editions after the first; a few are
critical.

Since ten of Mr. Lawrence’s books were first published in America, some
consistent method had to be found for ranking the American “firsts” of
an English author. The plan adopted for this work was to list the first
publication of each book, regardless of place of publication, as the
real first edition of that book. It was difficult to escape the logic
and common-sense of this solution of a vexing problem. But because
the whimseys, prejudices, and sentiments of book-collectors are often
notoriously free from logical or sensible restraints, all of the first
English editions of Mr. Lawrence are fully described, even though some
of them appeared months after the corresponding American editions.

Preceding each collation, the year, the month, and, in important
instances, the day of publication are given. This information, for the
American books, was supplied especially by Mr. B. W. Huebsch and Mr.
Thomas Seltzer. Similar information about the English books was received
from Mr. Lawrence’s London publishers, but only in part; in the main, the
year and the month of publication were taken from the _English Catalogue
of Books_. Information from this source does not always agree absolutely
with publishers’ records; but it was usually accepted as sufficiently
accurate, since the month of publication at least is oftener a nice
refinement in a bibliography than a significant fact. So much for the
first section of this study.

The other sections are: Translation; Contributions to Books;
Contributions to Periodicals; Studies and Reviews. All but the first of
these require some special comment.

In cataloguing Mr. Lawrence’s writings every reasonable effort was made
(with what success cannot now be told) to insure a complete record of
his numerous and varied contributions to books. In this business it is
plainly impossible to be sure that some items have not been overlooked.
Without in the least attempting to disarm criticism, one may properly
call attention to the great difficulty of running down anthologies of
modern poetry and prose, to the making of which there seems, indeed, to
be no end. Added to this is the even greater difficulty of ascertaining
what these anthologies contain, without examining each one separately.
There simply isn’t an index of modern collections of poetry. And indices
of the short story leave much to be discovered elsewhere.

Nevertheless, under Contributions to Books are listed some thirty volumes
with Lawrence material. They are treated in two ways: the books which
contain Lawrence “first printings between boards” are fully described
and annotated; those which include reprintings only are not described,
but the extent and the source of Mr. Lawrence’s contributions to them
are noted. The former are genuine Lawrence items and should be in a
comprehensive collection of his writings.

In the fourth section of this study will be found an approximately
complete record of Mr. Lawrence’s contributions to periodicals. These
contributions are not, everything considered, numerous. There are reasons
for this. It has not been Mr. Lawrence’s custom to publish novels
serially. He is not a voluminous writer of short stories, contenting
himself, evidently, with being a great one. He has never been much given
to reviewing, or to any other sort of hack-writing. Plainly, these are
not Mr. Lawrence’s ways of keeping the pot boiling.

But numerous or not, the contributions to periodicals are often of
great interest—even for reasons unrelated to technical bibliography.
For example, many American reviewers of _Studies in Classic American
Literature_, published August, 1923, were bewildered by what they
considered a surprise attack along our Parnassian front. Others, less
alarmed but scarcely more informed, found a direct connection between
the book and Mr. Lawrence’s visits to our shores in 1922 and 1923.
“Obviously,” they seemed to reason, “the author of this volume came to
_These States_ for a first-hand view of our literary shrines, and here is
the critical account of his pilgrimage.” All very interesting, if true.
In point of fact, long before 1923 many of the studies, in their first
forms, lay quietly inurned, but recoverable, in the files of the _English
Review_. The earliest study goes back to November, 1918, and most of the
others followed hard upon the first.

There is, too, something for the collector among the contributions to
periodicals. Items of particular interest to him are commented upon. In
this connection, a special effort was made to list the Lawrence material
in out-of-the-way magazines. Some of this sort to which Mr. Lawrence
contributed were, alas, not long for this hard world. _The Blue Review_,
_The Signature_, and _The Seven Arts_ are typical examples of such
ephemera.

Although perhaps a majority of Mr. Lawrence’s contributions to
periodicals were subsequently used in certain of his works, many remain
uncollected. The notes which follow the separate items will usually
enable the curious to distinguish the collected from the uncollected.
They will also show that Mr. Lawrence often altered the titles of poems
and stories before including them in his books. But there the notes
stop. No consistent effort was made to deal with the larger phase of Mr.
Lawrence’s textual revisions. That lies outside the scope of this volume.
However, a comparison, say, of the stories in _The Prussian Officer_ with
their first published forms will show that Mr. Lawrence’s revisions go
much beyond titles.

Regarding the chronological lists of Studies and Reviews little need
be said—except perhaps in apology. They do not, strictly, belong in a
volume of this sort, but were finally included for whatever value they
might have as an index to the critical comment on Mr. Lawrence’s writings
since the publication of _The White Peacock_. The lists make no claim
to completeness. Nevertheless, they are probably more inclusive than
they should be. Along with much that is fine, they contain much that is
pointless and futile. But this is not surprising: the average critic
sitting in judgment of Mr. Lawrence is quickly _au bout de son latin_.

Such, then, is the general plan of this bibliographical study. Designed
primarily to meet the needs of Lawrence collectors, it will also be
serviceable to students of what is now the most brilliant and challenging
career in really contemporary English literature. And it may have a
further use. Although Mr. Lawrence is quite without the sort of pride
in authorship that busies itself with shapes of books or records of
publications, he may nevertheless find in this glorified card-index some
usefulness. If so, I shall be repaid for the making of it.

And now a word of thanks for help on this book must go especially to Mr.
Lawrence, to Mr. Harold T. Mason, to Mr. David Jester, Jr., and to Mr.
Carroll Frey. Mr. Lawrence first told me about _Movements in European
History_, and he has generously forwarded my work in other ways. The
intrepid publishers of this volume made it possible for me to examine
duplicates of the various Lawrence items, and Mr. Mason’s knowledge of
the investiture of the books herein described was frequently drawn upon.
Mr. Frey helped with the typography—which in a book like the present
is no small matter. I am also indebted to a number of people, both in
England and America, for replies to many sorts of questions.

An appropriate conclusion to this introduction would be, I have no doubt,
a solemn recital of the General Confession. But there’s no good here
prating of things done or left undone. There simply isn’t. Bibliolatry
has its virtues, but sweet charity is not among them. Indeed she’s not.
All this by way of letting the users of this book know that reports of
my sins of omission and commission will be received with true stoical
fortitude.

_The White Peacock_, Mr. Lawrence’s first book, was published by William
Heinemann from plates imported from Duffield and Company, New York. The
omission of the English printer’s imprint was, however, accidental, not
intentional. The exact date of the publication of the English edition
was January 20, 1911, while that of the American issue was January
19. It is evident, therefore, that _The White Peacock_ was meant to
appear simultaneously in England and America. The book was, of course,
manufactured late in 1910, and copyright proceedings were begun in both
countries in this year, which is, in fact, given in the copyright notice
in the American book.

The first binding order on the English _White Peacock_, I am informed by
William Heinemann, Ltd., was for 750 copies. The second binding order was
for a like number. The two bindings differ on one point. The first has a
blind stamp of the Heinemann device, the wind-mill, on the back cover;
the second has not. However, both “cases,” which are otherwise alike,
contain the first printed sheets. The inadvertent omission of the stamp
from the second binding is the sort of variation which often occurs when
the same sheets are bound at different times.

Copies of the first edition of _The White Peacock_ are now genuinely
scarce. The book is seldom listed in catalogues, where later Lawrence
items are usually to be found. It is well known that certain books of
comparatively recent publication tend, for one reason or another, to
disappear. These are often first books, the initial editions of which
are seldom large. _The White Peacock_, a notable first novel, is a good
example of this tendency. I believe that the Heinemann _White Peacock_
is as scarce as the Methuen _Rainbow_, universally regarded as the
rarest Lawrence item. Certain it is that I have seen more copies of _The
Rainbow_ in fine condition than I have seen of _The White Peacock_ in any
condition.

Collectors who have a copy of this book, and who are curious about Mr.
Lawrence’s comment on the textual change made after the sheets were
bound, will probably find a tipped-in leaf at pages 229 and 230. I have
examined only four copies. All of these had the inserted leaf. I suspect
the bowdlerizing was efficient and thorough, but I cannot, under the
circumstances, be sure. However, in connection with this textual change
appears my reason for including a collation of the American first edition
of this book. The Duffield text is unaltered, as a comparison of the
English and American editions of 1911 will show.

Dealers in modern first editions call _The Trespasser_ a “hard” book.
It _is_ scarce, but the dealers protest too much. Surely they are not
correct in assuming, as they frequently do, that _The Trespasser_ is as
scarce as the Heinemann _White Peacock_, even if good copies of it are
difficult to come by—as they certainly are.

Although the above is the genuine first issue of _The Trespasser_, there
are extant copies identical with it on the inside, but in a light green
“case,” lettered on the front in black and on the backbone in gilt—except
_Duckworth_, which is in black. The curious who have at hand a first
edition of Mr. W. H. Davies’ _Beggars_, also published by Duckworth, will
know the cover-design of _The Trespasser_ in green. The texture and the
color of the cloths differ somewhat. I know nothing about this unusual
form, except that the copy I have is on the inside, page for page,
identical with the above. One other copy has been reported to me, by Mr.
Arthur Rogers, an English dealer.

The publishers (their file copies of _The Trespasser_ having disappeared)
are a bit vague, but they suggest that perhaps copies for the Colonial
market were bound in green. This may be the answer; but since the green
“case” is certainly more elaborate, and was probably more expensive than
the blue, one suspects the former may have been a “trial” binding.

The first American edition of _The Trespasser_ was published, from the
Duckworth sheets, by Mitchell Kennerley, New York, 1912.

_Love Poems and Others_ was Mr. Lawrence’s third book, and his first
volume of poetry. As to the comparative scarcity of this first edition
opinion differs greatly. Of the six books of poems (not counting _Bay_, a
private press volume) by Mr. Lawrence, I am inclined to rank _Love Poems_
third in scarcity. I suspect that both _Amores_ (first issue, with the
catalogue) and _Look! We Have Come Through!_ are scarcer than this item.
Be that as it may, _Love Poems_ is far from common. Fortunately, however,
the book was stoutly built, and copies of the first edition, when they do
turn up, are usually in quite satisfactory condition—satisfactory even to
collectors.

The first American edition of _Love Poems and Others_ was published, from
the Duckworth sheets, by Mitchell Kennerley, New York, 1913.

_Sons and Lovers_, now universally acclaimed one of the great novels of
recent years, appeals strongly to many collectors who go in for modern
first editions. The significance of the book was realized soon after
its publication, and copies of the initial printing were evidently
read, passed around, and reread. As a result, copies of this edition
in excellent state are now seldom seen. Most show signs of hard use.
Nevertheless, all Lawrence collectors entertain the hope of having some
fine day an _editio princeps_ of _Sons and Lovers_ in what they can
superciliously call “pristine condition.” The incorrigibly optimistic
want even the original dust-cover.

While waiting for this perfect copy, some collectors may do well to
make sure that their present copies are of the first issue; for _Sons
and Lovers_ is rather a tricky item. A later issue in lighter blue
cloth, without date on title-page, must not be confused with the real
first issue described above, the cloth of which is an unusual dark
blue—somewhat lighter than navy blue.

The first American edition of _Sons and Lovers_ was published, from new
plates, by Mitchell Kennerley, New York, 1913.

The first of Mr. Lawrence’s two published plays. It is not generally
realized that the American issue of _The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd_
preceded the English, which was, as a matter of fact, made from the
Kennerley sheets. A not overly close examination of a Duckworth copy
of this book will show that the fly-leaf with the series-title, etc.
on recto, was cut out after the sheets had been sewed together. This
accounts for the slight difference in the pagination of the two editions.
Then, also, the matter on the reverse side of the Duckworth title-page
clearly indicates that all of the sheets were American.

The first edition of _The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd_ was one thousand
copies. Five hundred of these were sent to Duckworth and Company, and
were by this house bound in the dark blue “case” described below. There
is no certain way of telling which of the two books is the scarcer; but
I should not be surprised to find that copies of the American issue are
the harder to come by—at least, in good state. The English book still
performs the trick of turning up over here in quite new condition.

_The Prussian Officer_ was Mr. Lawrence’s first volume of short
stories. The first edition of this book exists in two several issues.
The difference between them is marked, not by the binding, but by
the catalogues at the end of the volumes. One of these catalogues is
described above; the other, twenty instead of sixteen pages, is: _A
Selection from_ / _Duckworth & Co’s._ / _List of Publications_

The publishers were unable to say which catalogue was in the first issue,
and showed what amounted to alarm that anyone should be interested in the
matter. They evidently regarded their correspondent as mildly insane.
Publishers are of two varieties: the sort who understand the collector
not at all, and the sort who understand him too, too well.

I have examined five copies of the book. All but one had the catalogue
mentioned in this note. What deduction may safely be made from this?
Perhaps, that copies of the issue which I have collated are the scarcer.
But are they also necessarily the earlier? One may well have doubts about
that.

A somewhat detailed study of the two types of catalogues in Duckworth
books between 1913 and 1916 is unfruitful, except to show that the
catalogue mentioned in this discussion occurs in _Sons and Lovers_
(1913), and that in the collation above appears in _Amores_ (1916). But
since the latter list seems to contain no book published after 1914, it
might properly occupy space in a volume brought out in December of that
year. The question of the real first issue of _The Prussian Officer_
must, therefore, remain unsettled. One thing is certain: both books here
discussed are of the first edition. A later issue, in somewhat lighter
blue cloth, lettered in black, must not be confused with either.

The first American edition of _The Prussian Officer_ was published, from
the Duckworth sheets, by B. W. Huebsch, New York, 1916.

_The Rainbow_, universally considered by dealers and collectors alike
Mr. Lawrence’s scarcest book, was published, according to _The English
Catalogue_, in October, 1915. The publishers, however, said that the
exact date of issue was September 30, 1915. And with that they stopped,
for they seemed unwilling to give me any more information about the book.
Altogether wry was the letter they wrote. But from other sources it is
evident that _The Rainbow_ was in circulation just six weeks before
action for its suppression was successfully carried on November 13,
1915. The curious may consult a communication by G. W. de Tunzelmann,
published in the _Athenæum_, November 20, 1915, which, if accurate, fixes
the date of suppression.

Regarding the circumstances attending the action against the publishers,
a letter by Mr. Gilbert Cannan, New York _Tribune_, January 10, 1920, is
worth reading. Mr. Cannan asserts that after proceedings were brought
“the publishers, taking alarm and not understanding what had happened,
did not defend.” This is substantially what Mr. Lawrence says in his
preface to the present volume. The upshot of it was the publishers were
fined and ordered to destroy their stock of the book, after which, one
may suppose, all went “on with the War.” Whether such copies as the
publishers had on hand were committed to the tender mercies of the public
hangman, I do not know. At any rate, it may be safely assumed that
Methuen & Co., Ltd., complied fully with every mandate of the court, and
that they distributed no copies of _The Rainbow_ after November 13, 1915.

In his preface above Mr. Lawrence mentions the protests of Mr. Arnold
Bennett and Miss May Sinclair against the suppression of _The Rainbow_.
I regret my inability to give specific references to the time and place
of these protests. But all indices failed me, and both Mr. Bennett and
Miss Sinclair wrote that they could not now tell me where to look for
their parts in the controversy. Both wrote against the suppression, but
apparently in letters—not in special articles. In her reply to my inquiry
Miss Sinclair gave this indication of her position: “I said that the
suppression of this book was a crime, the murder of a beautiful thing.”

The first American edition of _The Rainbow_ was published, from new
plates, by B. W. Huebsch, New York, 1916. Subsequently Mr. Huebsch
brought the book out in a more expensive form, but the text remained the
same as that of the first American edition. These are the expurgated
forms to which Mr. Lawrence refers. _The Rainbow_, with the Huebsch text,
was published by Thomas Seltzer, New York, 1924.

It will be seen from all this that the complete text of the novel which
lies so close to the affections of its author is to be found only in
copies like the one collated above. The Methuen _Rainbow_ is, I need
hardly say, a very scarce book. Whether or not it is scarcer than the
Heinemann _White Peacock_ must remain a matter of opinion.

_Twilight in Italy_ was Mr. Lawrence’s first book of non-fictional
prose. Copies of the first edition of this book are scarce, and they are
exceedingly hard to get in fine condition. The cloth is usually faded
and the gilt dull. I have seen at various times perhaps a half-dozen
copies. They were all very much the same: that is to say, none was in
fine state. I suspect the book never looked quite new, and that it is one
of the many illustrations of how the War affected adversely workmanship
in the bookmaking industry. Be that as it may, _Twilight in Italy_ is
worth having in any condition. It should be more widely read. Like _Sea
and Sardinia_, it is too often merely a name, even to admirers of Mr.
Lawrence’s other work.

The first American edition of _Twilight in Italy_ was published, from the
Duckworth sheets, by B. W. Huebsch, New York, 1916.

AMORES / Poems / By / D. H. Lawrence / (_publishers’ device_) / London /

    COLLATION:—pp. viii + 140, consisting of title-page, as above
    (verso blank), pp. (i, ii); dedication, _To_ / _Ottoline
    Morrell_ (verso blank), pp. (iii, iv); table of _Contents_, pp.
    v-vii; p. (viii) blank; text, pp. 1-(138). Printers’ imprint,

    by T. and A. Constable, Printers to His Majesty_ / _at the
    Edinburgh University Press_ Pp. (139, 140) blank. At end of
    volume there is 16-page, numbered but undated, catalogue of _A
    List of the Libraries_ / _and Series of Copyright_ / _Books

Crown 8vo, 7¼ × 4⅞; issued in dark blue cloth; front cover blank;
backbone ornamented and lettered across in gilt: (two lines at top) /
_Amores_ / _Poems_ / _D. H._ / _Lawrence_ / _Duckworth_ / (two lines at
bottom). Back cover has in lower left corner blind stamp of publishers’
device. Top and fore edges cut; bottom edges untrimmed. End-papers white.

_Amores_, Mr. Lawrence’s second volume of poems, is a troublesome item.
The first edition exists in two states. The first has the 16-page
catalogue; the second does not. At no place in either issue is there a
date. Copies with the catalogue would seem to be rare. At least I have so
concluded after a sustained investigation. Copies without the catalogue
are “easy,” and these are commonly sold—perhaps naturally enough—as of
the first issue, which they are not.

The first American edition of _Amores_ was published, from new plates,
by B. W. Huebsch, New York, 1916. At least two differences between
it and the above ought to be noted. First, in the American edition
the dedication is extended, and reads: _To_ / _Ottoline Morrell_ /
_in tribute_ / _to her noble_ / _and independent sympathy_ / _and her
generous understanding_ / _these poems_ / _are gratefully dedicated_ / .
Second, the poem called “Disagreeable Advice” in the above, appears in
the American edition under the happier title “Irony.”

_Lawrence_ Top edges cut; fore edges cut, but in part unopened; bottom
edges untrimmed. End-papers white.

_Look! We Have Come Through!_ was Mr. Lawrence’s third volume of verse.
It is, with the doubtful exception of _Birds, Beasts and Flowers_,
his most notably original contribution to modern poetry. The relative
scarcity of copies of the first edition of _Look! We Have Come Through!_
is discussed in the note on _Love Poems_, and nothing more on that point
need be said here.

The first American edition of _Look! We Have Come Through!_ was
published, from the Chatto and Windus sheets, by B. W. Huebsch, New York,
1918.

    three books of _Poems by the Same Author_ at head; and
    acknowledgement, _Two of these poems have appeared in the
    English Review._ at foot of verso), pp. (1, 2); title-page,

Crown 8vo, 7½ × 4⅞; issued in grey wrappers; front cover has two-line
border in blue, and is lettered in blue as follows: _New_ / _Poems_ /
_By_ / _D. H._ / _Lawrence_ / _London_ / _Martin Secker_ / _MCMXVIII_
(All this lettering enclosed by elongated box formed by two vertical
lines inside border). Inside front cover, back strip, inside back cover
are blank. Back cover lettered in blue as follows: (Publisher’s device,
with name, _Martin Secker_) / _xvii Buckingham Street_ / _Adelphi_ Top
and fore edges cut; bottom edges untrimmed.

The first edition of _New Poems_ was printed on what must have been
almost the worst of all possible war-time paper; and since, in addition,
the book lacked the security of a substantial “case,” I suspect this item
will before long become scarce.

The first American edition of _New Poems_ was published, from new plates,
by B. W. Huebsch, New York, 1920. This edition, too, has an interest
for the Lawrence collector; it contains a significant prefatory essay,
which is not in the English issue, and which, Mr. Lawrence says, “should
have come as a preface to _Look! We Have Come Through!_” This “Preface”
is notable for its lucid and brilliant comment on the nature of poetry.
One finds Mr. Lawrence recurring to some of the tenets here expressed,
when on those too few later occasions he has commented on the poetry of
others, more especially on that of Whitman. This essay first appeared in
_The Playboy_, Numbers 4-5 (not dated), under the title “The Poetry of
the Present.”

Crown 8vo, 7½ × 5⅛; issued in decorated boards, with vellum back; front
and back covers blank; lettered up the back strip in gilt as follows:
(small ornament) _Bay_ (dot) _D. H. Lawrence_ (small ornament). Top edges
rough trimmed; fore and bottom edges untrimmed. End-papers white.

The three forms of _Bay_ are fully described in the collation above,
except as to the following points: (1) the copies on cartridge paper,
with decorations in color, have a green buckram back; (2) the copies on
hand-made paper have the same green buckram back, but the decorations are
not in color; (3) owing to an accident, only about half of the cartridge
paper edition was ever issued. All examples of this book are scarce. And
this is a great pity, for _Bay_ contains some of Mr. Lawrence’s finest
short poems.

_Touch and Go_ is one of the easier Lawrence items. It is not difficult
to get, but it _is_ quite worth having. The play is interesting; the
preface is extremely uproarious.

The first American edition of _Touch and Go_ was published, from new
plates, by Thomas Seltzer, New York, 1920.

Medium 8vo, 9½ × 6¼; issued in dark blue cloth; front and back covers
blank; backbone has four merely ornamental raised bands, and is lettered

(a line) / _D. H. Lawrence_ / (two lines at bottom). Top and fore edges
uncut; bottom edges rough trimmed. End-papers white.

The “tall, blue _Women in Love_.” In this form Mr. Lawrence’s most
significant and most characteristic novel had its first restricted
circulation. Copies of this issue are not very scarce. Just why is
difficult to say. Perhaps the edition was not fully bought up (however
much it deserved to be) when the novel was published in a cheaper form by
Mr. Seltzer, October, 1922.

A few (less than twenty-five) copies of this form of _Women in Love_ were
autographed, on the title-page, by Mr. Lawrence. These signed copies were
the first numbered, and except for the signature, are identical with the
above. They should not be confused with examples of the autographed form
of _Women in Love_ described below as item 14B.

The first English edition of _Women in Love_. This edition, which was

first printing are becoming scarce. Catalogues sometimes allege that this
edition was “withdrawn from circulation.” Mr. Secker says that it was not.

top) / _Women in_ / _Love_ / _(dot)_ / _D. H._ / _Lawrence_ / _1920_ /
(one thick, one thin line at bottom). Back cover same as front. Top edges
dark green and cut; fore and bottom edges untrimmed. End-papers white.

This small edition of _Women in Love_ was done by Martin Secker, who
imported the sheets for it from America. These sheets were the same as
those printed for item 14, which was, of course, brought out by Thomas
Seltzer, but without his imprint.

Except for size, copies of this edition of _Women in Love_ are uniform
with the Secker format of Mr. Lawrence’s novels, beginning with _The Lost
Girl_ and followed by the ordinary _Women in Love_ described immediately
above.

Before the Seltzer sheets were put into the Secker “case,” they were
trimmed about five-sixteenths of an inch at the top by the English
binders. This accounts for the slightly greater height of the copies
in the blue “case.” I mention this because the signed copies in brown
are sometime described as the tall-paper copies. Obviously any such
description of the Secker book needs qualifying. All this may be summed
up as follows: all forms of the “1920” issues of _Women in Love_, whether
signed or not, whether bound in blue or brown, were from the sheets of
the Seltzer privately printed edition. To this summary may be appended
the following observations: (1) these “1920” forms constitute the real
first printing of _Women in Love_; (2) this is one of the two books which
Mr. Lawrence has thus far signed—and the only novel.

    Secker (Ltd.), 1920_ at foot of verso), pp. (3, 4); table

Crown 8vo, 7½ × 5; issued in brown cloth; front cover, unlettered, has

ornamented and lettered across in gilt as follows: (one thin, one thick
line at top) / _The Lost_ / _Girl_ / (dot) / _D. H._ / _Lawrence_ /
_Secker_ / (one thick, one thin line at bottom). Back cover same as
front. Top and fore edges cut; bottom edges untrimmed. End-papers white.

The first edition of _The Lost Girl_ exists in three states. These are:
first, that which has the text exactly as Mr. Lawrence first wrote
it; second, that which has the original text altered, the alterations
occurring on two cancel-leaves, which, tipped-in, replaced two leaves
with the original matter; third, that which has the altered pages not
tipped-in, but as integral parts of the signatures to which they belong.

It is not generally known that any changes were made in the text of
_The Lost Girl_ after the book had been printed, but such is the case.
These textual changes were made on pages 256 and 268, and necessitated
tipped-in leaves at those places in the book. The cancel-leaves have
been held, by a few careful dealers, to mark the real first issue. To
most dealers this “point” is evidently unknown. Mr. Martin Secker,
answering my inquiry about the changes in this book, wrote as follows:
“The explanation of the tipped-in pages in _The Lost Girl_ is that it
was thought expedient to make certain verbal alterations in the text, a
decision which was come to after the book was printed. As far as I know,
all copies of the English edition in circulation are like this.”

This letter would seem to justify anyone in assuming that copies with
the tipped-in leaves were of the first issue. But, as a matter of fact,
copies with the original text are extant. At least one such copy has
fallen into my hands. It came from an English dealer through the Centaur
Book Shop. I have neither seen nor have I heard of another such copy.
But that some few more are in circulation is likely. In any case this is
certain: the unaltered form of _The Lost Girl_ is a scarce book, perhaps
even a rare one. So much for the first and second states.

Regarding the third state, little need be said. One might be justified in
reporting it as a second printing; but since there is nothing in the book
to indicate a complete reprinting, it seemed better to regard it as one
form of the first edition, as I have done.

The first American edition of _The Lost Girl_, which has the altered
text, was published, from new plates, by Thomas Seltzer, New York, 1921.

_Movements in European History_, written by Mr. Lawrence and published
under the _nom de plume_ Lawrence H. Davison, is in effect an elementary
textbook on the history of continental Europe from the beginning of the
Christian era to the unification of Germany. But it is more than that.
To say that the book is alive, that it interprets rather than catalogues
historical events, that it deals with these events frankly rather than
cautiously, that it is written with spirit and can be read with pleasure,
and, finally, to assert that nowhere about the book does one smell
pedagogy, is to say in a variety of ways that _Movements in European
History_ is very much more than an elementary textbook.

The initial edition of this interesting item exists in two forms. The
first is described above; the second differs from the first in that it
has a light brown binding, all other points being identical. The initial
printing was exhausted the first year, and the book was reprinted in
1922. Both first forms differ in several ways from the reprint, which
has, on the verso of an undated title-page, a line of type as follows:
_First published 1921; reprinted 1922_

At the time this note is written (late September, 1924) plans are on foot
to reissue _Movements_ with an epilogue and illustrations. The former
will presumably bring the story of European history down to the present.
In its new form, as in its old, the book will in England bear the imprint
of the Oxford University Press.

The first American edition of _Movements in European History_ will
probably be published next spring, with Mr. Lawrence’s authorship
acknowledged, by Thomas Seltzer, New York.

PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE UNCONSCIOUS

Published July 1923

PSYCHOANALYSIS AND / THE UNCONSCIOUS / By D. H. Lawrence / London /
Martin Secker / Number Five John Street Adelphi

    COLLATION:—pp. 128, consisting of half-title (with list of
    eight books _By the same Author_ on verso), pp. (1, 2);
    title-page, as above (with _London: Martin Secker (Ltd.) 1923_
    on verso), pp. (3, 4); table of _Contents_ (verso blank), pp.
    5, (6); divisional half-title (verso blank), pp. (7, 8); text,
    pp. 9-(128). Printers’ imprint at foot of p. (128) as follows:
    _Printed in Great Britain by Butler & Tanner, Frome and London_

Crown 8vo, 7¼ × 4¾; issued in garnet cloth; front and back covers blank;
backbone has cream paper title-and-name label lettered across in red as
follows: (a line) / _Psychoanalysis_ / _and the_ / _Unconscious_ / (a
line) / _D. H. Lawrence_ / (a line) / _Secker_ / (a line). Top and fore
edges cut; bottom edges rough trimmed. End-papers white.

The American edition of _Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious_, which was
the first, exists in two forms. I collated both the so-called “Special
Issue” and the ordinary edition because I know that many collectors, as
well as some dealers, have been puzzled about the first forms of this
book. A comparison of items 17 and 17A will show that the two forms of
the first edition of _Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious_ differ in the
following respects: first, the “Special Issue” has a certificate of issue
on the verso of the half-title, but is on the inside otherwise identical
with the ordinary form—even to the broken U on page nine, in the word
“Unconscious;” second, the sheets of the “Special Issue” measure 7⅜ × 5,
while those of the ordinary issue measure 7⁵⁄₁₆ × 5; third, in keeping
with this difference, perhaps, the outside measurements of the “Special
Issue” are slightly larger all around; fourth, the boards of the two
forms are different in color; fifth, the lettering on the “Special Issue”
is darker than that on the ordinary copies.

Just why the “Special Issue” was done is not exactly clear. Perhaps
some plans with regard to it miscarried, and the idea of a real limited
edition was given up. At any rate the five copies of the book I examined
were all unnumbered, and the original price on them was that of the
regular edition. It is not too much to say the limited “Special Issue” of
_Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious_ is freakish rather than any thing
else. It is a collector’s item.

After the first edition of this book had been exhausted, Mr. Seltzer
issued the second printing in a more substantial “case,” that is to
say, in cloth, in which form it is now available. It will be noticed
from the collations above that the first American edition preceded the
corresponding English edition by more than two years.

In spite of all that critics have said or may say about _Psychoanalysis
and the Unconscious_ and its successor, _Fantasia of the Unconscious_,
one thing is clearly incontrovertible. It is this: both of these books,
especially the latter, reveal flashes of illumination, such as are found
in imaginative thought—and nowhere else.

    divisions of the work, at pp. (7), (15), (21), (27), (37),
    (43). Pp. (8), (14), (16), (20), (22), (28), (36), (38), (42),
    (44) blank.

CONTENTS: Baby Tortoise; Tortoise-Shell; Tortoise Family Connections; Lui
et Elle; Tortoise Gallantry; Tortoise Shout.

Small medium 8vo, 9 × 6; issued in old gold boards; front cover has
picture in many colors; in right of foreground giant tortoise is
suspended, in framework of heavy timbers, by rope around his middle;
in the middle-ground and background, showing through heavy-timbered
frame, is one of Hiroshige’s views of Fujiyama, the whole being a
reproduction of a print by this artist; front cover lettered in black
in imitation Chinese lettering as follows: _Tortoises_ / _by_ / _D. H.
Lawrence_ Backbone has white paper title-and-name label lettered in
black: (vertical line) _Tortoises—D. H. Lawrence_ (vertical line). Back
cover blank. Top edges cut; fore edges uncut and unopened; bottom edges
untrimmed. End-papers white.

This is the first and only separate edition of _Tortoises_, which book
has never been published in single-volume form in England. Its first
appearance there between boards was in _Birds, Beasts and Flowers_, where
it occupies pages 117-138. Although this item is still easy to come by,
Lawrence collectors who haven’t it will do well to get copies soon.
Already English catalogues list _Tortoises_ at a price considerably in
advance of the American publication price. Naturally the book is less
common in England than here.

    COLLATION:—pp. 356 (together with frontispiece and seven pages

    (7, 8); divisional half-title, pp. (9, 10); text, pp. 11-355;
    p. (356) blank. There is no printer’s imprint. Pp. (3), 100,
    148, 180, 204, 236, 268, 300 are faced by illustrations in
    color tipped-in, all with protecting tissue. P. 44 is faced by
    map, in black.

Medium 8vo, 9¼ × 6¼; issued in light green boards with yellow cloth back,
approximating half-cloth; front and back covers blank; backbone has light
green paper title-and-name label lettered across in dark blue as follows:
_Sea_ / _and_ / _Sardinia_ / (small ornament) / _By_ / _D. H. Lawrence_ /
(small ornament) / _Thomas Seltzer_ (all surrounded by one-line box). Top
edges cut; fore and bottom edges untrimmed. End-papers white.

_Sea and Sardinia_ was Mr. Lawrence’s second volume of travel
sketches—only “travel” and “sketches” are not quite the words needed
here. In any case, a glorious book. Something will be gained if all
persons ignorant of _Sea and Sardinia_ (and _Twilight in Italy_) stop
pretending to a full knowledge of Mr. Lawrence’s prose. Because the book
has nowhere had the reading it deserves, the first issues of _Sea and
Sardinia_, both American and English, are still relatively easy to get.

Except for size, the English edition of _Sea and Sardinia_ is uniform
with the Seeker format of Mr. Lawrence’s novels, beginning with _The Lost
Girl_. It is a beautiful book. Indeed, taken merely as a book, this is
perhaps the most beautiful Lawrence item.

_England, My England_ was Mr. Lawrence’s second volume of short stories.
It came almost eight years after the first. However, the long interval
between _The Prussian Officer_ and this second collection would seem to
have less significance in his career as a writer of short stories than
some reviewers of _England, My England_ tried to make out. At any rate,
the title story of the latter volume appeared in the _English Review_
in October, 1915, and some of the other stories were published several
years before their appearance in book form. All this as may be, _England,
My England_ is a Lawrence item of great importance. The book is still
“easy” in either the American or the English first form.

_Studies in Classic American Literature_ is, so far, Mr. Lawrence’s only
sustained work in literary criticism. Many of these essays first appeared
serially in the _English Review_. The dates of their appearance in that
journal are given under Contributions to Periodicals, where a paper on
Whitman in the London _Nation_ is also noted. Before their publication
in book form the essays were materially revised, and several new studies
were added.

Five volumes of _Georgian Poetry_ have so far been published. All but
one of these volumes, that for 1916-1917, contain contributions by Mr.
Lawrence. He is represented in the above collection, at pages 113-116,
by “Snap-Dragon,” a poem which was printed in the _English Review_, June
1912, but which appeared for the first time between boards in _Georgian
Poetry_. It was later included in _Amores_.

In America, the five volumes of _Georgian Poetry_ were published, from
the Poetry Bookshop sheets, by G. P. Putnam’s Sons.

To the second volume of _Georgian Poetry_ Mr. Lawrence contributed
the following poems: “Service of All the Dead;” “Meeting among the
Mountains;” “Cruelty and Love.” They occupy pages 153-158. The last was
reprinted from _Love Poems_; the first was later included in _Look!
We Have Come Through!_ where it appeared under the title “Giorno dei
Morti.” “Meeting among the Mountains” has not, unless I am mistaken, been
included in any of Mr. Lawrence’s books of verse.

Poets_ Back cover blank. All edges cut flush with boards. Wrappers
over-lap top and bottom edges ⅛ inch, and fold in three inches at fore
edges of boards. End-papers white.

To this volume, the first of three _Imagist Anthologies_ published by
the Houghton Mifflin Company, Mr. Lawrence contributed seven poems as
follows: “Ballad of Another Ophelia;” “Illicit;” “Fireflies in the Corn;”
“A Woman and Her Dead Husband;” “The Mowers;” “Scent of Irises;” “Green.”
These poems occupy pages 67 to 78. The first and sixth appeared later in
_Amores_. The second, third, fifth, and seventh were included in _Look!
We Have Come Through!_ But, “The Mowers,” revised, was here printed under
the title “A Youth Mowing,” and “Illicit” became “On a Balcony.” “A Woman
and Her Dead Husband” is, in _New Poems_, “The Bitterness of Death.”

Because the contributors to the _Imagist Anthologies_ had agreed among
themselves to submit nothing that had previously appeared in book
form, these collections are of especial interest to collectors of Mr.
Lawrence’s first printings in books.

The _Imagist Anthologies_ were published in England by Constable and
Company, but after the American editions, which were the first.

To the second _Imagist Anthology_ Mr. Lawrence contributed five poems:
“Erinnyes;” “Perfidy;” “At the Window;” “In Trouble and Shame;” “Brooding
Grief.” These poems occupy pages 67-74. All but “Erinnyes,” most
beautiful of war poems, were later included in _Amores_. Any one of the
many anthologies of war poetry might have enriched itself greatly by
including “Erinnyes.” If any such collection did make use of this poem, I
am unaware of it.

To this, the third and last Houghton Mifflin _Imagist Anthology_, Mr.
Lawrence contributed only one poem, “Terra Nuova,” which occupies pages

under the title “New Heaven and Earth.”

To this representative collection of modern verse, prose, and pictures
Mr. Lawrence contributed two poems: “Labour Battalion” and “No News,”
which occupy pages 37-39. So far as I am aware neither of these poems has
been reprinted in any of Mr. Lawrence’s books of poems. It is likely
that the edition of _New Paths_ was small, for this book has already
become scarce—at least for an anthology.

An American edition of _New Paths_ was published by Alfred A. Knopf, New
York, 1918.

THE NEW KEEPSAKE FOR THE YEAR 1921

Published December 1920

lines_) Paris

A note must suffice to describe this very beautiful anthology of English
and French verse, prose, woodcuts, etchings, etc. The edition of _The New
Keepsake_ was limited to 620 copies for general distribution; 50 copies
on Japanese vellum, numbered from 1 to 50; 20 copies on blue vellum,
numbered from 51 to 70; 550 copies on hand-made paper, numbered from 71
to 620. The blue vellum copies were bound in black buckram, lettered in
pink; those on hand-made paper were done in yellow buckram, lettered in
black. I have not seen a copy of this book on Japanese vellum. Copies
on this and blue vellum are, in the nature of things, now very scarce;
but the cheapest form of the book can still be bought from dealers at a
nominal advance over publication price, which was 18s. 6d.

“Adolf,” Mr. Lawrence’s contribution to _The New Keepsake_, occupies
pages 19-33. It is a beautiful story—one which should certainly find
a place in some future collection of his shorter pieces. “Adolf” was
published in the _Dial_, September, 1920.

Three volumes of _The New Decameron_, an interesting anthology of modern
prose tales, have thus far been published. To the third of these volumes
Mr. Lawrence contributed one of the greatest of his short stories—“Wintry
Peacock,” which occupies pages 123-146. Although this story was included
in _England, My England_, its first appearance between boards was as a
part of the above collection. Mr. Lawrence did not contribute to the
first two volumes of _The New Decameron_.

Mr. Lawrence is represented in this volume by “Rex,” a dog story, which
was published in the _Dial_, February, 1921.

The appendix of _Stories from the Dial_ gives brief accounts of the
authors represented in the anthology, together with check-lists of
their principal works. The bibliographical note on Mr. Lawrence is very
inaccurate.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO PERIODICALS


* The notes in this section, so far as they assign or do not assign
the various contributions to Mr. Lawrence’s books, must be understood
to refer to titles rather than to the selections themselves. No
consistent effort has been made to ascertain how many of the unassigned
contributions appear in the books under new titles. Some do so appear
and are noted, but my knowledge of them is the result of casual reading
rather than deliberate investigation.

Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
